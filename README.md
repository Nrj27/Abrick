This repository contains two simple projects for beginners to learn programming and develop their skills. The projects included are:

1. Brick Breaker Game
2. Restaurant Order Management System

## Brick Breaker Game

The Brick Breaker Game is a simple game built using Java and the Java Swing library. The game involves breaking bricks with a ball, and the player can move the paddle to bounce the ball back up to the bricks. The game code is split into multiple files, each of which defines a different component of the game, such as the ball, paddle, bricks, and game panel. 

### Technology

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java Swing library

### Working

The game can be run by compiling the Java source code and running the resulting executable file. The player controls the paddle using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The objective of the game is to break all the bricks without losing all the lives.

### Purpose

The Brick Breaker Game is designed to help beginners understand the basic concepts of game programming and Java programming. The code is written in an easy-to-understand way and can be a great starting point for those looking to develop their own games.

## Restaurant Order Management System

The Restaurant Order Management System is a simple command-line application written in C++. The program allows the user to manage restaurant orders by creating, viewing, deleting, and adding items to orders. The program uses a linked list data structure to store order information. The program has a simple menu system that allows the user to select the function they want to use.

### Technology

- C++ programming language

### Working

The user interacts with the program through a simple menu system that allows them to create, view, delete, and add items to orders. The program stores the orders using a linked list data structure, making it easy to manage and modify the orders.

### Purpose

The Restaurant Order Management System is designed to help beginners understand the basic concepts of programming and data structures. The code is written in an easy-to-understand way and can be a great starting point for those looking to develop their own command-line applications.

## Conclusion

These projects are designed to be beginner-friendly and provide a good starting point for those looking to learn programming or develop their skills. The repository includes documentation for each project to help users understand the code and how to use it.
